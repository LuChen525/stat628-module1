### Introduction 
The goal of this project is to develop a simple rule of thumb technique for estimating the body fat percentage using only measurements which can be easily obtained. After data cleaning, variable selection, model evaluation and diagnostic, we finally got:

BODYFAT \% = 0.91 ABDOMEN(lbs) - 0.14 WEIGHT(cm) - 40 \% 

This estimator is easy to understand and can be quickly computed since it only uses two variables.
